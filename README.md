JSON-RPC Client Socket
=================

A class to make calls to a JSON-RPC based server service. 
This is a JSONRPC Client Socket, made from plain TCP.
HTTP is not official to JSON-RPC so that might come later. 

TCP makes this as smooth and fast as possible. No overhead, no headers just calls to external
JSON-RPC services. 

Support for JSON-RPC version 2.0
It doesn't accept version 1.0.

Specification can be found here:
http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#response_object

Code is fully commented, licensed with a MIT license. 
No guarantees for the working ability to this class are made.

Have fun coding,
